This is a practice following an online course of Javascript with Jonas Schmedtmann in Udemy.

In this web application, we use leaflet JS library for map interaction, where you can mark the location on the map and create a list of physical exercise data.

This project focuses on the practice of ES6 classes, JS library, and API.
